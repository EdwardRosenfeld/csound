\section{dripwater}
dripwater --  Semi-physical model of a water drop. \subsection*{Description}


 \emph{dripwater}
 is a semi-physical model of a water drop. It is one of the PhISEM percussion opcodes. PhISEM (Physically Informed Stochastic Event Modeling) is an algorithmic approach for simulating collisions of multiple independent sound producing objects. 
\subsection*{Syntax}


 ar \textbf{dripwater}
 kamp, idettack [, inum] [, idamp] [, imaxshake] [, ifreq] [, ifreq1] [, ifreq2]
\subsection*{Initialization}


 \emph{idettack}
 -- period of time over which all sound is stopped 


 \emph{inum}
 (optional) -- The number of beads, teeth, bells, timbrels, etc. If zero, the default value is 10. 


 \emph{idamp}
 (optional) -- the damping factor, as part of this equation: 


 damping\_amount = 0.996 + (idamp * 0.002)


  The default \emph{damping\_amount}
 is 0.996 which means that the default value of \emph{idamp}
 is 0. The maximum \emph{damping\_amount}
 is 1.0 (no damping). This means the maximum value for \emph{idamp}
 is 2.0. 


  The recommended range for \emph{idamp}
 is usually below 75\% of the maximum value. Rasmus Ekman suggests a range of 1.4-1.75. He also suggests a maximum value of 1.9 instead of the theoretical limit of 2.0. 


 \emph{imaxshake}
 (optional, default=0) -- amount of energy to add back into the system. The value should be in range 0 to 1. 


 \emph{ifreq}
 (optional) -- the main resonant frequency. The default value is 450. 


 \emph{ifreq1}
 (optional) -- the first resonant frequency. The default value is 600. 


 \emph{ifreq2}
 (optional) -- the second resonant frequency. The default value is 750. 
\subsection*{Performance}


 \emph{kamp}
 -- Amplitude of output. Note: As these instruments are stochastic, this is only an approximation. 
\subsection*{Examples}


  Here is an example of the dripwater opcode. It uses the files \emph{dripwater.orc}
 and \emph{dripwater.sco}
.
