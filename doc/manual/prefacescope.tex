\section{What is the scope of the Alternative Csound Reference Manual?}


  While there are numerous Csound-related projects, this manual only covers the canonical Csound program. This program is maintained by John ffitch and is stored on the Bath University FTP server (\emph{\url{ftp://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/newest/}}
). I apologize that I can't maintain the documentation for other projects. I simply don't have the time and resources to do so.
