\section{GEN14}
GEN14 --  Stores a polynomial whose coefficients derive from Chebyshevs of the second kind. \subsection*{Description}


  Uses Chebyshev coefficients to generate stored polynomial functions which, under waveshaping, can be used to split a sinusoid into harmonic partials having a pre-definable spectrum. 
\subsection*{Syntax}


 \textbf{f}
 \# time size 14 xint xamp h0 h1 h2 ...
\subsection*{Initialization}


 \emph{size}
 -- number of points in the table. Must be a power of 2 or a power-of-2 plus 1 (see \emph{f statement}
). The normal value is power-of-2 plus 1. 


 \emph{xint}
 -- provides the left and right values [\emph{-xint, +xint}
] of the x interval over which the polynomial is to be drawn. These subroutines both call \emph{GEN03}
 to draw their functions; the p5 value here is therefore expanded to a negative-positive p5, p6 pair before \emph{GEN03}
 is actually called. The normal value is 1. 


 \emph{xamp }
 -- amplitude scaling factor of the sinusoid input that is expected to produce the following spectrum. 


 \emph{h0, h1, h2,}
 etc. -- relative strength of partials 0 (DC), 1 (fundamental), 2 ... that will result when a sinusoid of amplitude 


 xamp * int(size/2)/xint\\ 
       
 is waveshaped using this function table. These values thus describe a frequency spectrum associated with a particular factor \emph{xamp}
 of the input signal.

\begin{itemize}
\item 

 \emph{GEN13}
 is the function generator normally employed in standard waveshaping. It stores a polynomial whose coefficients derive from the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, so that a driving sinusoid of strength \emph{xamp}
 will exhibit the specified spectrum at output. Note that the evolution of this spectrum is generally not linear with varying \emph{xamp}
. However, it is bandlimited (the only partials to appear will be those specified at generation time); and the partials will tend to occur and to develop in ascending order (the lower partials dominating at low \emph{xamp}
, and the spectral richness increasing for higher values of \emph{xamp}
). A negative \emph{hn}
 value implies a 180 degree phase shift of that partial; the requested full-amplitude spectrum will not be affected by this shift, although the evolution of several of its component partials may be. The pattern +,+,-,-,+,+,... for \emph{h0,h1,h2..}
. will minimize the normalization problem for low \emph{xamp}
 values (see above), but does not necessarily provide the smoothest pattern of evolution.

\subsection*{Examples}


  Here is a simple example of the GEN14 routine. It uses the files \emph{gen14.orc}
 and \emph{gen14.sco}
. It creates a function which, under waveshaping, will split a sinusoid into 3 odd-harmonic partials of relative strength 5:3:1. Here is its diagram:
