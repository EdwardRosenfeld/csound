        for ink and outk were deprecated.

        * Thanks to Atte André Jensen, Matthew Gillard is now correctly 
        credited for the wterrain opcode.

        * Thanks to Dr. Richard Boulanger for pointing out an error with the 
        GEN01 routine.

        * Thanks to Kanata Motohashi for pointing out errors in the buzz, 
        gbuzz, mxadsr, and pvscross opcodes.

        * Added examples for the following opcodes: tableng.

        * Added examples for the following GEN routines: 01, 02, 03, 05,
        06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 19.

        * Added an example for the FLknob opcode, thanks to Dave Phillips
        for letting use one of his posts to the Csound mailing list.

        finding the vco opcode but were overlooking vco2.

        * Made some changes thanks to Luis Jure. Fixed the documentation 
        for the foscil opcode and the m statement. Made the Csound64 
        documentation a little more readable. Also fixed the "Random

        * Added examples for the following opcodes: soundin, sndwarp,
        subinstr, and wguide1.

        * Because it's easier to understand, I restored the use of the 
        soundin opcode in the examples of the following opcodes: babo, bbcutm,
        cross2, dam, dcblock, dispfft, flanger, follow2, follow, fout, hilbert,
        hrtfer, interp, nreverb, peak, pitchamdf, pitch, soundin, tempest, 
        and waveset.

        gbuzz opcode when the knh parameter is zero.

        * Thanks to a note from Gabriel Maldonado, added a warning about 
        using integer values for ksmps.

        * Thanks to a note from Jason Thomas, got rid of the broken example
