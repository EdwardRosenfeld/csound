\&\& --  Logical AND operator. \subsection*{Description}


  Arithmetic operators perform operations of change-sign (negate), don't-change-sign, logical AND logical OR, add, subtract, multiply and divide. Note that a value or an expression may fall between two of these operators, either of which could take it as its left or right argument, as in 


 a + b * c.\\ 
       


  In such cases three rules apply: 


  1. * and \emph{/}
 bind to their neighbors more strongly than + and \&\#8722;. Thus the above expression is taken as 


   \\ 
 a + (b * c)\\ 
       
 with * taking b and c and then + taking a and b * c. 

  2. \emph{+}
 and \emph{\&\#8722;}
 bind more strongly than \&\&, which in turn is stronger than ||: 


   \\ 
 a \&\& b - c || d\\ 
       
 is taken as 

   \\ 
 (a \&\& (b - c)) || d\\ 
       


  3. When both operators bind equally strongly, the operations are done left to right: 


   \\ 
 a - b - c i\\ 
       
 is taken as 

   \\ 
 (a - b) - c\\ 
       


  Parentheses may be used as above to force particular groupings. 
\subsection*{Syntax}


 a \textbf{\&\&}
 b (logical AND; not audio-rate)


  where the arguments \emph{a}
 and \emph{b}
 may be further expressions.
