tigoto --  Transfer control at i-time when a new note is being tied onto a previously held note \subsection*{Description}


  Similar to \emph{igoto}
 but effective only during an i-time pass at which a new note is being ``tied'' onto a previously held note. (See \emph{i Statement}
) It does not work when a tie has not taken place. Allows an instrument to skip initialization of units according to whether a proposed tie was in fact successful. (See also \emph{tival}
, \emph{delay}
). 
\subsection*{Syntax}


 \textbf{tigoto}
 label


  where \emph{label}
 is in the same instrument block and is not an expression, and where \emph{R}
 is one of the Relational operators (\emph{$<$}
,\emph{ =}
, \emph{$<$=}
, \emph{==}
, \emph{!=}
) (and \emph{=}
 for convenience, see also under \emph{Conditional Values}
).
