Problems of which we are aware
==============================

Named instruments do not work unless in a list 
    ie instr foo fails but "instr foo, 1" works
       -- fixed in git sources 2013 Apr 10 08:30 UT
chnset locks were NULL
       -- fixed in git sources 2013 Apr 12 06:30 UT
wrong goto token synthesized for if-then
       -- fixed in git sources Apr 13 23:07:03 2013 +0100
if-then in UDO would not properly set label jumps when called
    in recursive UDO's, also cause of issue with recursive
    UDO's recursing one extra time
       -- fixed in git sources Sun Apr 14 14:41:30 2013 +0100 
kr,ksmps vars not set in local-ksmps UDOs
       -- fixed in git sources Sun Apr 14 18:50 UT
wrong perf function selected in recursive UDOs with local ksmps
      -- fixed in git sources  Sun Apr 14 19:52 UT
T opcode arg type did not match against reserved var types (r-)
      -- fixed in git source Wed Apr 17 11:47 2013 +0100
local ksmps UDO breaking multicore performance assumptions
      -- fixed by setting local ksmps for opcodes instead of the global ksmps, completed Wed Apr 17 12:49:05 2013 +0100
semantic phase: label list creation did not correctly walk TREE*
    to find all labels:
        -- fixed in git sources Apr 18 15:31 2013 +0100
if-then blocks were not being expanded correctly, with bug 
    presenting consistently in case of nested if-then's
        -- fixed in git sources Apr 19 17:44 2013 +0100
