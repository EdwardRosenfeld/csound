Problems of which we are aware
==============================

Named instruments do not work unless in a list 
    ie instr foo fails but "instr foo, 1" works

chnset locks were NULL
       -- fixed in git sources 2013 Apr 12 06:30 UT
wrong goto token synthesized for if-then
       -- fixed in git sources Apr 13 23:07:03 2013 +0100
if-then in UDO would not properly set label jumps when called
    in recursive UDO's, also cause of issue with recursive
    UDO's recursing one extra time
