BUILDING CSOUND 5
Michael Gogins
18 October 2005

The main build system for Csound 5 uses SCons. Its use is briefly described here. Csound has become a complex project and can involve many dependencies. Unless you are a Csound developer or need to develop Csound plugins, you should try to use one of the precompiled distributions from http://sourceforge.net/projects/csound.

All Csound 5 builds require the following:

1. On Linux, install gcc; on Windows, install MinGW with MSYS, or install MSVC; on OS X, install the latest XCode development system.
2. Install Python from http://www.python.org. Note that on Windows, if you have installed both MinGW and MSVC, it is best to use batch files to set up a separate environment for each compiler that does not refer to any header, library, DLL, or executable of the other compiler.
3. Install SCons from http://www.scons.org.
4. Install libdsndfile from http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile.

It is best to obtain current Csound 5 sources from CVS at http://sourceforge.net/projects/csound.

Optional configurations can include the following. In most cases it is best to install the most recent stable versions.

4. For GUI widgets, install FLTK from http://www.fltk.org. You must configure and build FLTK with "--enable-threads".
5. Real-time audio can use ALSA, the Windows multimedia library, or PortAudio (v19-devel branch) from http://www.portaudio.com/usingcvs.html.
6. Real-time MIDI can use PortMidi from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/portmusic.
7. CsoundVST, which is both a standalone GUI, a Python extension module, and a VST plugin form of Csound with extensive facilities for algorithmic composition, requires FLTK and the boost C++ libraries from http://www.boost.org.
8. The fluid opcodes require the Fluidsynth library from http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/fluid.
9. The STK opcodes require STK source code from http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk, copied into csound5/Opcodes/stk.
10. The Loris opcodes require Loris source code from http://sourceforge.net/projects/loris, copied into csound5/Opcodes/Loris,

Execute "scons -h" to discover the current configuration options.

Modify custom.py as required for your installation (usually required on Windows, may not be required on Linux).

Execute "scons" with the options you desire.

11. To install on Linux, execute "scons install". To install on Windows, use the NSIS installer from http://nsis.sourceforge.net and run csound5/installer/windows/csound.nsi.
