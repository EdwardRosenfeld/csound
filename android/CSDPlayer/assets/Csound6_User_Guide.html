<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is an extremely basic guide to
using the Csound 6 app for Android. It should be just enough to get
you started if you already have some experience with Csound or, at
least, with &ldquo;Music N&rdquo; type software synthesizers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Csound6 app is an Android version
of Csound, an audio and music synthesis and processing language of
great power, created by Barry Vercoe in 1984, maintained with
complete backward compatibility since then, and widely used and
taught for the creation of electroacoustic and computer music. Desite
its age, Csound6 remains under active development. It has many
advanced features for sound synthesis including user-designable
instruments, an easy to learn programming language with a type
system, several phase vocoders, several sample players, a plethora of
digital oscillators, filters, and envelope generators, transparent
multi-threading for high performance, and an embedded Lua
just-in-time compiler.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Csound app is by Victor Lazzarini,
Steven Yi, Michael Gogins, and others. The app contains virtually all
of Csound, including some of the more frequently used plugin opcodes:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The signal flow graph opcodes, for
	chaining instruments into effects chains and so on.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fluidsynth opcodes for playing
	SF2 samples.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The libstdutil library.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lua opcodes, which embed
	LuaJIT and enable arbitrary Lua code to execute in Csound either for
	signal processing or for score generation or, indeed, for any
	purpose. Particularly amazing is that LuaJIT has a foreign function
	interface that is capable of loading any shared library that Android
	permits, and calling any exported function in that library.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Csound6 has a preset user interface
consisting of four menu buttons, five sliders, five click buttons, a
trackpad, and three context menu help buttons. The menu buttons
perform the following functions: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>New</B></I> &ndash; creates
	a blank template CSD file in the root directory of the user's
	storage for the user to edit. The CSD file will be remembered and
	performed by Csound.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>Open </B></I><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal">&ndash;
	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">opens
	an existing CSD file in the root directory of the user's storage.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>
	The user's storage filesystem can be navigated to find other files.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>Edit</B></I> &ndash; opens a
	text editor to edit the current CSD file. Be sure to save the file
	before you perform it! I recommend the free, open source Jota text
	editor on smartphones and, though I haven't tried Jota on tablets,
	it probably works well there as well.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I><B>Start/Stop</B></I> &ndash;
	if a CSD file has been loaded, starts running Csound; if Csound is
	running, stops it. If the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">&lt;CsOptions&gt;</FONT>
	element of the CSD file contains <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">-odac</FONT>,
	Csound's audio output will go to the device audio output. If the
	element contains <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">-osoundfilename</FONT>,
	Csound's audio output will go to the file <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">soundfilename</FONT>,
	which should be a valid Linux pathname in the user's storage
	filesystem.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The widgets are assigned control
channel names <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">slider1</FONT>
through <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">slider5</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">butt1</FONT>
through <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">butt5</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">trackpad.x</FONT>,
and <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">trackpad.y</FONT>. In
addition, the accelerometer on the Android device is available as
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">accelerometerX</FONT>,
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">accelerometerY</FONT>, and
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">accelerometerZ</FONT>. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The values of these widgets are
normalized between 0 and 1, and can be read into Csound during
performance using the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">chnget</FONT>
opcode, like this: 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">kslider1_value
chnget &ldquo;slider1&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area below the trackpad prints
messages output by Csound as it runs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="Csound6_User_Guide_html_773f6605.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=19 WIDTH=297 HEIGHT=586 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>On
Csound's SourceForge page, in the Files section, there is an archive
of examples for the Csound6 app. Not all of these examples use the
widgets, and some of them write audio to soundfile and not to the
audio device. They do demonstrate not only some techniques for using
the Csound6 Android app, but also a few of the many different ways of
making music with Csound.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When I first encountered the Csound
app, I was very impressed. Now that I have been able to contribute to
its development, I have come to realize that a high end smartphone,
not to mention a tablet, is in every sense of the word a real
computer. The limits to what can be programmed on it are indefinable.</P>
