Csound 6 TODO list

1) loadable instruments:
 - AST tree memory recovery needs fixing.
 - memory recovery of pools
 - test extensively (including UDOs and namedins)
 - add support for fast loadable format
 - document AST tree format to allow users to parse into it.
 - API functions
 - thread safety ?
 - UDOs are not replaced, memory recovery needed? 
 - add opcode to compile/load an opcode

2) allow any number of strings in score events (except p2,p3)

3) test sample-accurate opcodes, or document those not working

4) Use instrument-local structure rather than global (ksmps mainly)

5) New DAG control without memory use

6) Whittle code needs rewrite to avoid copyright infringement and to
make it easier to maintain

7) Analysis formats need to be byte-order/machine independent, and
reader opcodes need to accept them
