Csound 6 TODO list

1) loadable instruments:
 - AST tree memory recovery needs fixing.
 - test extensively (including UDOs and namedins)
 - add support for fast loadable format
 - document AST tree format to allow users to parse into it.
 - API functions
 - thread safety ?
 - add opcode to compile/load an opcode

2) allow any number of strings in score events (except p2,p3)

3) test sample-accurate opcodes, or document those not working

4) Use instrument-local structure rather than global (ksmps mainly)

5) New dag control without memory use

6) Whittle code needs rewrite to avoid copyright infringement and to
make it easier to maintain
