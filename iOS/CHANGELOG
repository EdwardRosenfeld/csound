5.19.02.x - 2013-xx-xx

* CsoundObj.m: Replaced audio route handling code with simpler code setting category default to Speaker (Contributed by Stephan Hepper)

5.19.02.2 - 2013-03-20

* CsoundObj.m: Added [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:.001] in while loop to prevent loop from being optimized out; caused issue when compiling application with -O1 or higher (i.e. -Os used when building for Release)

* CsoundObj.m: Updated audio route handling to take into account AirPlay; also, now correctly routes to speaker and not earpiece even upon repeated connection and disconnection of headphones

5.19.02.1 - 2013-02-11

* CachedButton.m: fixed issue where it would initially start with a state of 1 even if not pressed down
* CsoundObj.m: added startCsoundToDisk method for Csound rendering to disk; added TrappedGenerator example that demonstrates how to use this
* CsoundObj.m: fixed issue where when CsoundObj start, if headphones were plugged in, audio would start through the speaker; now checks if headphones are in to use the default audio route, and if not to use the speaker
