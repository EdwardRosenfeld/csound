What is New, What has Changed
=============================

Build system in cmake (and not scons as in Csound5)


Note events can start and end in mid-kcycle.  As Thi sis an
incompatable change it is only invoked with the command-line option
--sample-accurate
is specified.  Not that this does not work for tied notes, and use of
skipping initialisation has questionable use.


A nuber of table access opcodes have been rewritten but should behave
the same.  Smilarly diskin and diskin2 now use the same code and so
diskin should be more stable


Arrays....


Real-time mode....
