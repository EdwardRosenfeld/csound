# Csound with Lisp
Michael Gogins

This directory contains some examples and this documentation for using Csound with several bodies of algorithmic composition 
code written in Lisp or Scheme.

## The Csound Lisp API

The examples have been tested with sbcl (Steel Bank Common Lisp) on Ubuntu 14.04.

The interfaces/csound.lisp file defines a Lisp cffi wrapper for many of the most useful functions in the Csound API that is 
defined in include/csound.h.

To use this wrapper, you must install sbcl, then install and load the cffi package as documented here.

## Lisp

## Scheme

The Scheme examples have been tested in Grace.
