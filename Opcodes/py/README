PYTHON OPCODES FOR CSOUND
By Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu
Modified by Michael Gogins for Csound 5


BEFORE COMPILING

To generate the source code for the py-opcodes
just run the 

pycall-gen.py

and

pyx-gen.py

scripts in this directory.


NOTES

The {{ and }} directives for mutiple-line strings are not implemented in 
Csound 5, so many of the examples will not run without editing.
