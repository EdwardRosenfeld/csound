   * Base class for compositions

   * A music graph is a directed acyclic graph of nodes
   * including empty nodes, nodes that contain only child nodes,
   * score nodes, event generator nodes, event transformer nodes,
   * and others. Each node is associated with a local transformation
   * of coordinate system in music space using a 12 x 12 homogeneous matrix.
   * To generate the score, the music graph is traversed depth first, and
   * each node postconcatenates its local transformation of coordinate system
   * with the coordinate system of its parent to derive a new local coordinate system,
   * which is applied to all child events.
