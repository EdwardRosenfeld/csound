/**
* These are the declarations for the Silence framework,
* in other words all the classes defined in the Silence library itself.
* There must be one header file and one source file for each framework class.
* <p>
* SWIG is run on this file to generate wrappers for all Silence framework classes
* in other languages, especially scripting languages such as Python,
* Therefore, all framework headers must be included in this header,
* and all framework headers must use #ifdef SWIG to declare
* the module and make other SWIG declarations (see Node.h for an extensive example).
* The order of declaration is important to SWIG!
* <p>
* It is also expected that doxygen will be used to generate documentation
* from comments in the framework header files.
