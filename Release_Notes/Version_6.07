The Developers 



USER-LEVEL CHANGES
==================

New opcodes:

    o    compress2: like compress but using a more normal use of dB
         (0.0 for full scale).

    o    (Experimental) New cuda opcodes cudasynth2 and cudanal2.

    o    directory opcode: Reads a directory and outputs to a string
         array a list of file names.   

    o    ftsamplebank:to load a sample library from a directory.

    o    mvclpf1, mvclpf2, mvclpf3, mvclpf4, mvchpf: Moog
         voltage-controlled filter emulations from Fons Andriaensen.

New Gen and Macros:

    o    

Orchestra:

    o    The boolean ?..:.. construction can now have string results,
         while previously it only allowed numbers.

    o    The line number reported when an error is detected at the end
         of a line is now correct.  Also more improvements in line numbers
         for complex syntax

    o    While loop improved/fixed
    
    o    Better and consistent reading of comments

    o    Continuation lines handled better, especially respecting line
         numbers
         
Score:

    o    The list of tempo points in score opcode t is now arbitrarily
         long

    o    A stupidity in r and { opcodes fixed

Options:

    o    The -z option now suppresses deprecated opcodes, unless given
         a 2 or 3 argument


Modified Opcodes and Gens:

     o   In OSC opcodes it is now possible to send and receive arrays,
         tables and audio

     o   Better diagnostic if diskin2 fails

     o   Rezzy now checks for unstable filter and modifies to close
         stable version

     o   adsr rewritten so it gives an error if the segments are
         longer than p3

     o   Use of diskin to an array ow resizes the output array if
         necessary

     o   chnget now checks for a change in chanel name as well as data

     o   interp can take an optional extra argument to give an initial
         value

     o   oscilikts uses a more liberal table lookup

     o   opcode in can read mono or stereo, obviating the in/ins
         distinction

     o   sensekey rewritten to provide better diagnostics and fixes a
         minor bug

     o   Fix to a case of defining a macro with arguments

     o   sockrecv now works at a and k rate

Utilities:

  o    

Frontends:

  pnacl: 

  icsound:

  csound~:
        
  Emscripten:

  csdebugger:
  
       * Some memory issues fixed

  HTML5:

  CsoundQT has its own notes at
  https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/blob/master/release_notes/Release%20notes%200.9.2.md


General usage:

    o   The multicore options somewhat improved

    o   When replacing instruments the new version inherits maxalloc
        and active flags

    o   Multicore code now works wit midi instruments

    o   MIDI operations now available via jack (***NEEDS ORE***)
    
    
Bugs fixed:

    o   Fix to trigseq

    o   Major error in rezzy fixed

    o   p() fixed for high numbers of p-arguments

    o   p() now works from MIDI events

    o   The 31-bit random number generator could give a very short
        loop if seeded with zero; fixed

    o   Macros in .orc files now work

    o   A long-standing bug in display of graphs fixed

    o   Fixes to the envelope opcodes linen, expsegr, linsegr,
        cossegr, transegr

    o   Many fixes in string opcodes (strsub, strcpy and others)

    o   Fixed bugs in print formats (sprintf printf prints)

    o   pvsmooth had a missing initialisation

    o   Array initialisation now robust

    o   Bug in copya2ftab fixed

    o   Fix in cudapvsanal (EXPERIMENTAL)
====================
SYSTEM LEVEL CHANGES
====================

System changes:

    o   Extensive use made of in-memory files.  Orc and sco are always
        thus, as are .csound6rc.  This simplifies much internally

    o   Nested longjmps fixed which affected some API use.

    o   If a non-existent .csd file is presented Csound no longer
        crashes
