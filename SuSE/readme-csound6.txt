GETTING STARTED

CsoundQT, a graphical shell for Csound, makes an excellent place to begin 
the exploration of Csound, especially because CsoundQT has an extensive menu 
of built-in examples that show off Csound's capabilities. Many musicians make 
CsoundQT their main Csound environment, although there are other excellent 
environments. CsoundQT runs not only Csound code, but also Python scripts.

The tutorial/tutorial.pdf file is an illustrated tutorial of how to 
find, install, configure, and use Csound. To get started with 
real-time MIDI performance, for example, see Section 2.1.3.

The examples directory contains numerous working Csound orchestras and 
even complete pieces. The examples/Boulanger_Examples directory contains
hundreds of working Csound orchestras.

The doc/manual/html/indexframes.html file is the front page to the 
Csound Reference Manual.

This version of Csound is programmable in Python, Java, Lua, and LISP, 
and scores can be generated in these languages. 

The doc/manual/api/index.html file is the front page to the C/C++ 
Csound and Csound API application programming interfaces reference,
but it is also helpful when programming Csound in other languages.

CONTRIBUTORS

Csound was originally developed by Barry L. Vercoe of the Music and
Cognition Group at the Media Laboratory, M.I.T., Cambridge, MA, USA
with partial support from the System Development Foundation and from
the National Science Foundation Grant #IRI-8704665.

Most of the Csound code has been modified, developed, documented and
extended by an independent group of programmers, composers, and
scientists.
